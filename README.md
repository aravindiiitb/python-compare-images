# python-compare-images

This repository is mainly about comparing two images. 
The technique used is SSIM. i.e. Structural Similarity Index Measure

We use some of the inbuilt functions available in python's skimage library to measure the SSIM value. 
Along with SSIM we also measure the MSE ( Mean Square Error )

To know more about the SSIM technique Refer Here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity 
# Instructions-to-Run
if you don't have skimage library. Install it using the following command in linux machine.

sudo pip install scikit-image

then just execute python compare.py to run the programme.
